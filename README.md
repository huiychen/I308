Information Presentation

For the final team project we designed and built a database for the Student Records System. We were given some preliminary information about this, but there are some of the requirements below are slightly different than our example and that there is additional material. 

We produced quries to retrieve certain student information such as producing a class roster for a *specified section* sorted by studentâ€™s last name and first name, producing a list of all students who took a course that had a prerequisite but the student had not taken the prerequisite, including the semester, the course subject and number, and the grade the student received, and producing a list of students and faculty who were in a *particular building* at a *particular time*, including in the list faculty and advisors who have offices in that building.
